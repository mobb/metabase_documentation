Fork 9
Data Set file Information:
Wed Sep 11 13:31:07 PDT 2013

backward compatible? yes 
essential? yes

Goals:
1. SBC and MCR need to build URLs to data entities. FilePath has a PK for each path. We need the file path in the parent table to hold several root paths, and we will add subpaths to this to build a full URL.

2. we need to hold everything that is in our EML documents.

Justification (goal 1):
We analyzed our URLs to find:
number of URL-heads and subpaths.
SBC: 5 URL-heads and 30 subpaths for 287 entities.
MCR: 16 URL-heads and __ subpaths for 181 entities.

URL-head will go into FilePath, and have an id (PK)
The subpaths are best kept in a controlled vocabulary, but there is no place for this. Adding this table will greatly ease our management.


Justification (goal 2)
EML has elements that there is currently no place in metabase for. these are necessary for parsing of files content: collapseDelimiters, literalCharacter, physicalLineEnding


Approach:
1. New Table: SubPathList (the table name follows Wade's naming convention)
Two columns, 
a) for the controlled vocabulary of sub-paths
b) a notes column



2. Add a column to DataSetFile called SubPath. 
FK constraint to SubPathList.
It's contents will be combined with FilePath.PathURL (in the parent table) to build a URL to an entity (file)

3. Add 3 columns to FileTypeList
collapseDelimiters, literalCharacter, physicalLineEnding
