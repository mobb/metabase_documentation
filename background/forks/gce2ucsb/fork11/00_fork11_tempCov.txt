Fork 11
Temporal coverage for datatsets. 

Wed Sep 25 09:59:44 PDT 2013



backward compatible? yes 
essential? yes

Background:
SBC and MCR are pulling temporal coverage pulling info from EML into Metabase. They will pull it back out via mb2eml.
EML can accomidate temporal cov at several levels, and SBC and MCR use at least 2 (?? and maybe references via ids)

Metabase has only one table that contains begin/end dates: DataSetStudy. It may not work will for our needs.  

Fork 11 Goals:
1. handle all the EML features that SBC and MCR use (elements, attributes within geocov tree)
2. handle temporal coverage trees at multiple levels



General Approach:
There are no parent tables to populate.

A. these 3 x-ref tables were added (new)
DataSetTemporal
DataSetEntityTemporal
DataSetVariableTemporal 




TO DO:
get an image of 'original'
get a screenshot after schema spy is rerun.(see whiteboard pic till then)
