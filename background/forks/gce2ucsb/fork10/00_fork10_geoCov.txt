Fork 10
Sampling sites for datatsets.

backward compatible? yes 
essential? yes

Background:
SBC and MCR are pulling sampling site info from EML into Metabase. They will pull it back out via mb2eml.
EML can accomidate geocov at several levels, and SBC and MCR use at least 3 (plus references via ids)

Metabase has tables and columns for most info in EML's geocov tags. It has other mgt fields as well.. 

Metabase has a concept of "Super site" and "sub site". Only one level of 
parentage is allowed. Super sites have bounding boxes, and sub sites do not (ie, are single points). Super sites cannot be described as withing other super-sites.

Our policies for use of geocov trees at different levels:
SBC:  
1. original (full nodes) should be at the highest level possible. 
2. prescriptive trees belong at the dataset level, and can be referenced at lower levels as needed.
3. descriptive trees can be put at the entity level. 
4. usually, only references will appear at the attribute level.
5. we will investigate using the sampling tree, as recommended by EML BP.

MCR:
1. 


Fork 10 Goals:
1. handle all the EML features that SBC and MCR use (elements, attributes within geocov tree)
2. handle geocov trees at multiple levels
3. set up our usage of Metabase to accomodate self-referencing sites, so that sites can be nested.


General Approach:
A. populate these Metabase parent tables
SiteTypeList (existing)
SuperSite (existing, modified)
SiteCoordsDeg (existing)
SiteCoordsKML (existing)
SiteAltitude (new)

and these x-ref tables
DataSetSites (existing, modified)
DataSetEntitySites (new)
DataSetVariableSies (new)

Fork SQL:
1. widen column for the field SiteCode in several tables. Required drop-reload of entire DB. 
these tables: 
the diffs look like...
<     "SiteCode" character varying(10) NOT NULL,
---
>     "SiteCode" character varying(50) NOT NULL,
2459c2459
<     "SiteName" character varying(50) NOT NULL,
---
>     "SiteName" character varying(100) NOT NULL,
2461c2461
<     "SiteDesc" character varying(750),
---
>     "SiteDesc" character varying(1000),
6411c6411
<     "TextPatternDefinition" character varying(100),
---
>      "TextPatternDefinition" character varying(500),

and the sed is here:
sed 's/"SiteCode" character varying(10) /"SiteCode" character varying(50) /'

sed 's/"TextPatternDefinition" character varying(100)/ "TextPatternDefinition" character varying(500)/'

(looks like Gastil recycled the above sed sh for SiteName and SiteDesc)
(and also at the same time, widened the TextPatternDefinition, which was for DataSetVaribles - fork4)




2. SuperSite: add a shape-type column to table
desiginates whether the site is a point, polyline, polygon, box or vector. 
a) handles current SBC practice and 
b) set up for which other tables should be populated (eg, SiteCoordsDeg or SiteCoordsKML) uses a constraint-check

3. SiteAltitude: add a new table.
a) is analogous to the other descriptive tables, SiteCoords* and 
b) accommodates the content for EML elements under boundingBox/altitude


4. DataSetSites: add cols for ei, ai, gci
a) holds cross-refs for geocoverage trees at dataset levels.

5. DataSetEntitySites: new table.
di, ei, sitecode, geocov-sortorder, isref
holds cross-references for geocoverage trees at the enity level
boolean to set whether a ref or not

6. DataSetVariableSites: new table. 
di, ei, ai, sitecode, geocov_sortorder, isref
holds cross-references for geocoverage trees at the attribute level.


TO DO:
get an image of 'original'
get a screenshot after schema spy is rerun.(see whiteboard pic till then)
