fork 8 did 2 things, both requring drop-reload 
Only one is a 'real' fork from gce-metabase, the other is choosing a postgres data type.

Fork 8a from gce-metabase
1. increase the lengh od DataSetEntities.EntityDescription to 1000 chars.

SEE FORK 7, ALL DataSetEntity changes ARE SUMMARIZED THERE.




Fork 8b
2. choosing a postgres data type
for metadata that is typed "real" change to "double precision"
this lets us have more digits in things like lat and lon.

 "EntityDescription" character varying(200) NOT NULL

    "Distance" real,
    "MinValid" real,
    "MinExpected" real,
    "MaxExpected" real,
    "MaxValid" real,
    "MinValue" real,
    "MaxValue" real,
    "EML_DatePrec" real,
    "MinValid" real,
    "MinExpected" real,
    "MaxExpected" real,
    "MaxValid" real,
    "MinValue" real,
    "MaxValue" real,
    datetime_precision real,

::real
real NOT NULL
real DEFAULT

Did this by sedding the create table statements on the whole damn dump. ick, but the only option.


sed 's/ real NOT NULL/ double precision NOT NULL/' | sed 's/ real DEFAULT/
double precision DEFAULT/'


then one other manual vi where the Hectacres was the last column in a CREATE TABLE
(so there was no trailing comma to match)
