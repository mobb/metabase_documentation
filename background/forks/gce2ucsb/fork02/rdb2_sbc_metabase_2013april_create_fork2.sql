SBC-II	Santa Barbara Coastal LTER Project	2006-10-01 00:00:00	2012-09-30 00:00:00	The primary research objective of the SBC LTER is to investigate the relative importance of land and ocean processes in structuring giant kelp forest ecosystems.	The primary research objective of the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER is to investigate\n            the importance of land and ocean processes in structuring giant kelp\n            (Macrocystis pyrifera)  forest ecosystems. As in many temperate\n            regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated\n            by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are\n            influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open\n            ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and\n            processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and\n            pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs.\n            Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary\n            production of kelp, and the population dynamics, community structure, and trophic\n            interactions of kelp forest ecosystems.

3	Overview	abstract	The condition and productivity of kelp forests appears to have profound effects on the structure and function of neighboring ecosystems whose food webs rely on allochthonous subsidies of organic matter. Exposed sandy beaches in southern California, which make up more than 70% of the mainland shoreline are a classic example of a subsidized ecosystem. The rich intertidal macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting beaches in the SBC region depend largely upon exogenous sources of organic matter because relatively little primary production occurs on the beach itself and there are no attached plants or macroalgae.     Much of the kelp NPP exported from SBC kelp forests is stranded on intertidal sandy beaches. Our time series datasets suggest that kelp forest canopy or biomass and wrack abundance on beaches are strongly linked.  These subsidies of drift macroalgae or wrack exported from kelp forests to beaches in the Santa Barbara Channel are substantial (500 kg m<superscript>-1</superscript> y<superscript>-1</superscript> for <emphasis>Macrocystis pyrifera</emphasis> alone) and support a large proportion of the intertidal beach food web. Our surveys of sandy beaches in the SBC have shown that the diversity, abundance and biomass of wrack-associated intertidal macroinvertebrates, such as talitrid amphipods and beetles, and of their shorebird predators respond positively to subsidies of macroalgal detritus or wrack from kelp forests.     We are exploring the role of beach consumers in the biological processing of imported drift macrophytes to better understand exchanges among kelp forests and other coastal ecosystems. We found that populations of one of major consumers of stranded kelps, including <emphasis>Macrocystis pyrifera</emphasis>, on SBC beaches, talitrid amphipods, can consume more than 18 kg of kelp month<superscript>-1</superscript> m<superscript>-1</superscript> of shoreline. These nocturnal consumers can rapidly convert wrack subsidies from kelp forests to animal biomass and prey for shorebirds and fish.  The action of these consumers also breaks down drift macrophytes to particles that are washed by waves and tides into the sand where they are subject to microbial activity.     The rapid processing of macroalgal wrack by invertebrate detritivores and its decomposition and subsequent nitrogen mineralization by bacteria can lead to high concentrations of dissolved nitrogen in saline intertidal porewater (&gt;1000 uM), particularly on beaches with heavy wrack accumulation, especially in the late summer and fall.  Dissolved nitrogen concentrations in porewater were strongly correlated with wrack biomass in late summer surveys.  Tidal pumping and beach drainage then drive the release of these dissolved nutrients to the swash and surf zones where they may be available to nearshore primary producers, such as feather boa kelp (<emphasis>Egregia menziesii</emphasis>) and surfgrass (<emphasis>Phyllospadix</emphasis> spp). We are investigating the potential for the beach ecosystem to represent a nutrient source to nearshore primary producers as wave and tidal activity circulates organic materials, such as wrack and phytoplankton, through beach sand where they are consumed, decomposed and mineralized.  This transfer of nutrient subsidies from kelp forests through beaches to nearshore macrophyte beds may represent a key ecoystem linkage in SBC.\r	1	2011-10-25 11:12:03.309198
9	Overview	abstract	Cross shelf processes can have a dramatic effect on the supply and export of key resources to and from nearshore kelp forest ecosystems on the narrow continental shelf in the Santa Barbara Channel. Our measurements have revealed seasonal differences in cross shelf gradients of organic and inorganic nutrients between the shallow rocky reefs where kelp forests occur and offshore pelagic ecosystems in the Santa Barbara Channel. We are quantifying key components of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool produced by the major groups of primary producers in the kelp forest, and assessing the ultimate fate of these materials within kelp forests and inner continental shelf ecosystems.     Kelp and other marine macrophytes produce prodigious amounts of DOM and up to half of the carbon fixed by phytoplankton can enter the DOM pool.  By examining the production and fate of this material we seek to quantify a major pathway of carbon export from the reef ecosystem and thus fill a critical knowledge gap.     Nutrients sequestered in organic matter (OM) are of particular interest because of their potential ecological and biogeochemical significance.  Organic matter (OM) is produced by photoautotrophic processes (phytoplankton and macroalgae) and partitioned into particulate (POM) and dissolved (DOM) phases.  The portion partitioned into DOM serves as a substrate for heterotrophic bacterioplankton processes, and factors that control the production and remineralization of DOM can have a profound influence on the distribution of nutrients within marine systems.  Despite its proximity to the coast and relatively high levels of phytoplankton productivity (&lt; 2 g C m<emphasis>-2</emphasis> d<emphasis>-1</emphasis> ) we observed DOM concentrations in the center of the Santa Barbara Channel to be less than or equal to concentrations measured in the subtropical oligotrophic gyre at the same latitude. This relatively low background concentration of DOM allows us to resolve relatively small changes in this important organic pool.     Our observations from a cross-shelf survey of the Santa Barbara Channel revealed a significant onshore to off shore gradient in the concentration of DOM and DOC (dissolved organic carbon) indicating the build up of a pool of organic nutrients that could potentially be available for export away from the nearshore.  Significant heterogeneity in DOM concentrations was observed throughout the Channel. This was likely controlled by DOC sources, sinks and dilution processes in this upwelling system.     Biogeochemically, the portion of newly produced DOM that is resistant to rapid microbial degradation is potentially available for export away from the shallow nearshore environment.  However, in order for DOM to be important in cross shelf transport a gradient must develop between the nearshore and offshore environments.  Knowledge of the sources and fate of the DOC produced in these upwelled water masses is needed to gain insight into the bioavailability of this important organic pool.  However, prior to our investigations little was known about the temporal evolution of this gradient, its persistence or how it developed in the context of primary productivity and potential availability to heterotrophic microbes.     To explore the evolution of this cross shelf gradient, we initiated a cross shelf time series study to investigate the temporal and spatial gradients of particulate and dissolved organic matter and their potential sources and sinks in the near shore environment.  Monthly measurements of POM, DOM, macro nutrient concentrations, biomass, productivity and community structure of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton communities were collected for 16 consecutive months from 4 depths at 5 stations that spanned from the Mohawk kelp forest to 3 km offshore.  Our preliminary analysis of these data show significant temporal variability in cross shelf transport that can cause clear isolation or strong influence from offshore waters on the kelp forest ecosystem.  Results from our horizontal transect from the Mohawk kelp forest illustrates the seasonal gradients of organic and inorganic nutrients between the shallow rocky reef and deeper offshore ocean.  During periods of upwelling large pulses of inorganic nutrients can be introduced into the nearshore and offshore environments resulting in a phytoplankton bloom in early spring.  As upwelling relaxes and inorganic nutrients are drawn down temporal gradients in POM and DOM develop, reaching maxima by late spring/early summer.  A pronounced spatial gradient in POM and DOM can be observed with maxima developing closest to the kelp forest.  In order for DOM and POM to accumulate in the nearshore zone biological production and consumption processes must be uncoupled and the rate of physical dispersion must be less than net organic matter (OM) production.  Thus, the accumulation of OM in the nearshore environment suggests that the connectivity between kelp forests and the offshore ocean is reduced during periods when upwelling is relaxed and kelp forests become relatively isolated from offshore waters.     The source, quality and bioavailability of the resulting OM can have important implications for nutrient cycling within the kelp forest.  For example, if the DOM that accumulates nearshore is resistant to rapid microbial degradation, then nutrients sequestered in DOM and POM are potentially available for export. Additional microbial bioassays were also conducted throughout the study to assess the bioavailability of the accumulated DOM.  Analyses of these data are ongoing and should provide further insight into the fate of the accumulated OM and its potential for export from the nearshore environment.	1	2011-10-11 15:08:40.751764
8	Overview	abstract	Nitrogen, particularly dissolved N, is the nutrient believed to most frequently limit giant kelp growth and survival in southern California. Kelp forests have a low capacity to store N, requiring continuous N subsidies from land and ocean based processes to maintain growth. In the open system of the ocean, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) is quite dilute however, exogenous inputs of N can be large relative to potential capacity for internal N recycling in kelp forests.     Understanding the timing of delivery and sources of nutrients to kelp forests is central to predicting growth and productivity of giant kelp ecosystems. We are using a multi-faceted approach to evaluate the sources and relative inputs of dissolved N to SBC kelp forests.  Time series data obtained using an <emphasis>in situ</emphasis> nitrate analyzers moored at three of our long-term study sites (Carpinteria, Naples, Arroyo Quemado) provided the first high-resolution (every 30 minutes) time series of DIN concentrations for this environment. Our measurements show that DIN supply to the inner shelf of the Santa Barbara Channel varies seasonally and the major delivery mechanisms include upwelling, diurnal internal tides, and storm runoff.  Upwelling dominates increases of inner-shelf DIN between March and May and accounts for more than half of the annual advective DIN transport to shallow reefs where kelp forests occur.  In summer, internal tides bring relatively deep nutrient-rich deep waters onto the reef providing an important source of DIN to kelp forests in summer and fall when surface nutrient concentrations are depleted and other supply mechanisms are inactive. Brief episodes of upwelling can become important in late autumn and early winter.  DIN inputs from storm runoff, detected as salinity dilution at moorings at reefs and estimated from measurements of stream discharge and nutrient concentration, can be significant during winter runoff events.  Overall, our results indicate that most of the nitrate in the forest is delivered as a result of upwelling-favorable winds.  Internal waves and local streams contribute 9% of the nitrate delivered to the forest on an annual basis and 20% during periods when the ocean is stratified. Overall, our results show that kelp used less than 5% of the total nitrate supplied to the forest.     To determine the relative importance of these different sources of nitrate to the annual nitrogen needs of giant kelp <emphasis>Macrocystis pyrifera</emphasis>, we used the 13 month time series of ambient nitrate concentrations in the kelp forest at the Mohawk Reef (from the moored nitrate autoanalyzer described above) and characterized nitrate delivery from water column thermal structure and flow data collected in the forest interior and at its offshore edge. Rates of net nitrogen uptake by kelp were calculated for the entire forest (using data collected from our long-term studies of kelp NPP), and for a select subset of kelp fronds to isolate vertical and cross-shore differences in nitrogen acquisition.  Nitrate supply to the forest varied by a factor of 50, while measured net nitrogen acquisition varied only fivefold, regardless of the method used to measure it.  Maximum net nitrogen acquisition rates for fronds in the forest interior were 0.18 mmol N g<superscript>-1</superscript> month<superscript>-1</superscript> during spring upwelling and declined fourfold during autumn.  Modeled gross nitrogen uptake by giant kelp with consideration of Michaelis-Menten uptake kinetics for nitrate and mass transfer limitation was adequate to support observed net N acquisition except during the warm stratified summer and autumn months, when net acquisition exceeded modeled gross uptake. This shortfall implied that the kelp forest received over half its nitrogen from sources other than nitrate during this period. Results from monthly water sampling indicate that ammonium concentrations at SBC reefs exceed nitrate concentrations during summer and fall. A short-term field study found a strong diel pattern of ammonium concentration during summer with high concentrations of ammonium near the bottom in the morning and evening hours (nighttime sampling was not performed) suggesting that benthic sources of DIN, particularly ammonium, may be available to kelp from subtidal soft sediments.     Stable nitrogen isotope studies on forest consumers are providing further insights into the role of terrestrial N inputs. Overall, stable isotope values of reef consumers have indicated little direct use of terrestrially-derived POM.  However, the elevation of &#948;<superscript>15</superscript>N values of several benthic consumers along a gradient of increasing freshwater/land/agricultural influence suggest  that where available, land-derived N can be indirectly incorporated into kelp forest food webs.	1	2011-10-11 15:08:40.751764

11	Overview	abstract	Kelp forest ecosystems are inexorably linked to their fluid environments yet relatively little is known concerning their dependence on, and relationship to, key nearshore water column processes, Currents impinging on kelp forests deliver nutrients, plankton and other forms of organic matter that subsize the kelp forest food web and profoundly affect the structure, function and persistence of the kelp forest community. The kelp forest in turn modifies the flow of currents around and within its boundaries, and production and consumption by its inhabitants alter the concentrations of nutrients and dissolved and particulate organic matter within the forest. Determining the extent to which kelp forest structure and function are coupled to hydrodynamics, water column properties and the conditions that promoted this coupling  is very challenging given the complex physical, chemical and biological attributes of kelp forests and the waters that surround them.  Research that is being done by SBC LTER to address this challenge includes: (1) determining the degree to which impinging flows enter the forest as opposed to being diverted around it and the extent to which this is influenced by forest size and prevailing oceanographic conditions, (2) rates of consumption and production of waterborne subsidies (i.e., nutrients, POM, DOM) by key kelp forest inhabitants, (3) the interactive effects of nutrients, light, and flow in determining kelp growth, and (4) the implications of forest-flow interactions for the growth, reproduction and population dynamics of forest-dwelling suspension feeding invertebrates.     Our investigations of flow and kelp forest community structure, include physical, geochemical and biochemical analyses, and experimental manipulations, and exploit a breadth of expertise in hydrodynamics, marine ecology, biological oceanography, and algal physiology.	1	2011-10-11 15:08:40.751764
13	Overview	abstract	The loss of historical and ecological connections in landscapes is particularly evident in the coastal zone, where an ever-increasing proportion of the world population dwells. The inherent dynamism of coastal environments makes documentation of change and the establishment of baseline conditions especially challenging. The disappearance of wetlands, native vegetation and wildlife, and the alteration of natural processes have greatly affected the ecology of remaining coastal zone habitats, while the historical introduction of numerous species of plants and animals has transformed much of the open landscape.  At the same time, cultural and historic structures and land uses have vanished through modern development, change and decay.     As the goal of historic preservation has generally been to fix a historical moment rather than to acknowledge change, so ecological restoration has often sought to restore a landscape to a particular reference state.  However, since coastal landscapes embody highly dynamic processes rather than a steady state, what should the goals of restoration be?  Our study considers the landscape as a narrative that provides evidence of historical and ecological processes and connections that can be used to guide restoration of the natural dynamics of coastal ecosystems.     We are assembling the ecological and cultural history of a small fragment of the southern California coast, part of the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER, with the goal of developing a model approach for informing restoration and preservation efforts. The integration of historical methods and values into restoration ecology and conservation, as well as the integration of ecological values into environmental history are objectives of our case study. The study coastline offers a wide variety of habitats including sandy beaches, dunes, rocky tidepools, kelp forests, cliffs, a saltwater slough, coastal mesas, freshwater marshes and vernal pools. It also includes a long human history.  The setting is on the edge of a highly urbanized and quickly developing area, a liminal space that is a literal and symbolic borderland. Our comparisons utilize the rich fossil, archeological, historical and modern ecological information for this coastal site to evaluate landscape level changes occurring on the scale of tens of thousands to tens of years.  Documenting change in this dynamic environment is a multi-disciplinary process, requiring a wide variety of sources and inference. Our objectives are to provide historical and ecological context for a dynamic coastal landscape that can be used to inform ecological restoration goals and to provide a model in which historical and ecological features and dynamics of the landscape are integral components of the process of environmental and cultural restoration, conservation and preservation. This type of approach may become increasingly relevant in the face of anticipated impacts of global climate change on coastal ecosystems.	1	2011-10-11 15:08:40.751764

12	Overview	abstract	Marine ecosystems provide a myriad of ecosystem services that drive human behavior and actions, and are impacted by human actions, especially disturbances that vary in their form, frequency, and magnitude. In general, basic knowledge and the development of sustainable management of marine systems are limited by our understanding of human-marine resource interactions. The convergence of human and data resources in the Santa Barbara Coastal (SBC) LTER program is being used to pioneer a large-scale comparison of (1) human impacts on marine ecosystems, and (2) human adaptations to environmental change. The SBC LTER program is testing how fishing, an economically and culturally important form of disturbance, influences biotic structure and energy transfer, and in turn, how changes in these biophysical features influence the provision of ecosystem services, especially fisheries associated with giant kelp, the foundational species of the program.     Socio-ecological-systems research in the SBC LTER is also focusing on innovation in the in reef fisheries management. Classical approaches to fisheries management, mainly through stock assessment modeling, rely on on large amounts of fisheries data, and are expensive and time-consuming. As such, traditional approaches are not conducive to managing reef associated species for which relatively little data are available. &quot;Data-poor&quot; stocks include most nearshore reef fishes and invertebrates. Many of these organisms exhibit high spatial variation in harvest pressure and demographic rates, further limiting traditional stock assessment approaches. Ecologists in the SBC LTER are working with local spiny lobster and rockfish fishermen, the CA Department of Fish and Game, NOAA, and NGO scientists to develop new management strategies to overcome data limitations, account for spatial variability, and use marine reserves as ecological baselines to gauge exploitation rates and impacts. With implementation of no-take Marine Reserves in the Santa Barbara Channel ecosystem, there is great potential for improving decision-making in management through measurement of spillover from reserves, changes in the distribution of fishing effort, yield, and revenue, as well as refining estimates of key parameters, such as natural and fishing mortality through comparisons of fished populations with those in reserves. Such information can be used to enhance traditional stock assessments as well as collaborative, small-scale management approaches, including reserve-based Decision-tree frameworks. The latter appear to be more cost-effective and result in greater stakeholder buy-in than traditional top-down approaches. The SBC LTERs collaborative fisheries research program has measured the influence of 5 year-old marine reserves on lobster and rockfish populations, the related fisheries yields around reserves, spillover through tag-and-recapture studies, and changes in the distribution and revenue of fishermen. We have developed self-imposed decision tree catch controls for fishermen, and tested these management scenarios using data collected in the field with fishermen in Management Strategy Evaluation modeling, which compare long-term trends and sustainability of catches under traditional and decision-tree based management. We have also examined whether lobster fishing causes trophic cascades that are hypothesized to reduce kelp abundance on SBC LTER sampled reefs, and have generated a baseline data set for ecological and fishery responses to planned network of reserves on the mainland coast. Short-term future plans include sampling for spillover and fishery responses in the existing Channel Islands reserve network, and working with fishermen to optimize their catch around reserves, using experimental fishing practices. This work includes collaboration with UCSB environmental economists and human geographers.	1	2011-10-25 13:27:36.659566

1	Overview	abstract	Synthesizing long-term observations at multiple spatial and temporal scales is vital for describing and predicting ecosystem responses to a changing climate. However, relatively little is known about the regional scale variability in biomass and productivity of many subtidal ecosystems, as appropriate field surveys are both time and labor intensive. We have developed novel methods for measuring giant kelp (<emphasis>Macrocystis pyrifera</emphasis>) canopy biomass using multi-spectral SPOT and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery, which has allowed us to examine the dynamics of giant kelp biomass on spatial scales ranging from 100s of m<superscript>2</superscript> to 100s of km<superscript>2</superscript> and temporal scales ranging from several weeks to 25 years.  Regional giant kelp canopy biomass is highly variable (coefficient of variation ~100%), illustrating the important role of disturbance in regulating regional biomass. Comparisons of giant kelp biomass dynamics with environmental variables show that winter losses of kelp biomass are positively correlated with maximum winter wave heights and spring recoveries of kelp biomass are negatively correlated with sea surface temperatures (sea surface temperature is strongly negatively correlated with nutrient availability). On interannual time scales, regional kelp canopy biomass lags wave heights, sea surface temperature, and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) index by 3 years, suggesting there may be relationships between these variables and population-level recruitment and mortality cycles. However, the response of kelp biomass to environmental and climatic variables shows large levels of spatial heterogeneity.  The dynamics of kelp biomass in exposed regions are correlated to surface wave disturbance while kelp dynamics in sheltered regions track sea surface temperatures more closely.     We are utilizing the spatial and temporal coverage of this satellite dataset in a number of other related projects. For example, Landsat data is being used to compare variability in net primary production between central and southern California. We are also using the data to characterize the spatial structure and metapopulation dynamics of giant kelp populations throughout the Southern California Bight.  This dataset is allowing results from local field surveys to be scaled up and placed in a regional context.	1	2011-10-12 10:33:59.375053

2	Overview	abstract	Primary production forms the base that supports the vast majority of life on Earth. To understand this key ecosystem function in kelp forests, we are measuring net primary production (NPP) for the major types of primary producers in giant kelp forests: giant kelp, understory macroalgae, and phytoplankton.     Giant kelp (<emphasis>Macrocystis pyrifera</emphasis>) is the world's largest alga and is one of the fastest growing autotrophs on Earth. We are studying patterns and causes of variation in NPP by giant kelp at three reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel (Arroyo Burro, Mohawk and Arroyo Quemado).  Net primary production by giant kelp is estimated using monthly field measurements of standing crop and rates of biomass loss of kelp to estimate accumulation and loss of biomass. We combine these data with a simple model of kelp dynamics to estimate specific growth rates and NPP for each season of each year. These methods in part follow a conceptual approach common in terrestrial studies that calculate NPP by measuring accumulation and loss of biomass. We are using these and other data to explore the physical, chemical and biological factors controlling growth and NPP in giant kelp.     Primary production by understory macroalgae and phytoplankton in the kelp forest may be adversely affected by shading, flow attenuation, and other factors associated with the canopy formed by giant kelp. To quantify the effects of kelp forest canopy on primary production by understory macroalgae we measured oxygen evolution in closed benthic chambers inside and outside the kelp forest monthly. Phytoplankton production was simultaneously measured at the same locations using light and dark bottle incubations with 13 C-labeled bicarbonate as a tracer. These results in combination with our giant kelp NPP estimates allow us to compare the magnitude of NPP by the different primary producers of the kelp forest and estimate the potential effects of giant kelp on other primary producers.     Our ongoing research is investigating how the negative effects of giant kelp on understory algae and phytoplankton interact with wave disturbance and nitrogen loading to affect the magnitude and interannual variability of NPP by the kelp forest ecosystem as a whole.  Our long-term kelp removal experiment is a focal point for ongoing studies of these questions. This research is being facilitated by the use of a simple model of understory production which we developed that relates species-specific light use relationships measured in the laboratory to biomass and light levels measured in our long-term study plots.	1	2011-10-24 16:42:02.020069
5	Overview	abstract	Fire is a ubiquitous feature of ecosystems in Mediterranean climates, and climate change models indicate that the frequency of fires will increase with global warming and associated droughts. Three major fires occurred in the foothills and mountains above the greater Santa Barbara area between summer 2008 and spring 2009. Two of these large fires burned parts of the same basins, allowing an examination of impacts of fire timing on vegetation, soils, biogeochemistry, and stream communities within the same catchments. All of these fires were within the study region of SBC affording a unique opportunity to integrate multidisciplinary research to evaluate the effects of fire on terrestrial, riparian, stream, and coastal ecosystems.     To evaluate the effects of these major fires on SBC watersheds, soils, stream ecology, runoff, stream discharge and nearshore ecosystems SBC investigators are pursuing a multi-faceted research campaign. A wide range of landscape, geomorphic, ecological and biogeochemical data is being collected in a variety of burned and unburned SBC catchments. Our ongoing analyses of data from remote sensing of land cover of pre- and post-fire vegetation are deciphering the relative importance of vegetation type and moisture. Our spectral analyses of vegetation types indicate significant differences in the intensity of burn damage among the three fires and within fire scar areas. We are using LIDAR to generate bare-earth digital elevation models that can be used to track erosion of and sediment transport from burned catchments. Our analyses of soils are tracking the fate of nitrogen pools and export in the burned catchments. We are documenting regrowth of vegetation and resprouting of shrubs in the burned and unburned areas and evaluating the responses of stream invertebrates and algal community structure and food webs to disturbance by fires.  Our multi-year, multi-site analyses of export of nutrients and suspended solids, examination of concentration discharge relations, and impacts of land uses and of fires on solute and particulate export are indicating marked impacts of fires on these key processes. We are developing models that relate post fire climate variability to annual and peak daily streamflows, soil nitrogen, and recovery trajectories for chaparral biomass. The responses of annual streamflow to fire-related shifts in the dominant riparian overstory species are being modeled.	1	2011-10-24 16:44:36.557044
6	Overview	abstract	To improve our understanding of oceanic and cross-shelf processes that transport materials to and from kelp forests in the Santa Barbara Channel, SBC uses data from a variety of sources including ocean cruises, remote sensing, moored instruments, HF radar, and soon, ocean gliders.     Data obtained from 16 seasonal channel-wide cruises that surveyed hydrographic and biological parameters in the SBC between 2000 and 2006 are a major component of this effort.  Two undulating towed vehicles, Scanfish and a Triaxus, were deployed to obtain high resolution, two-dimensional maps of temperature, salinity, beam attenuation at 660 nm (a measure of water turbidity), and chlorophyll fluorescence from the surface to ~ 100 meters depth during each cruise. A set of cross-channel transects of CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) surveys along the towed vehicle tracks provided vertical profiles (surface to sea floor) of the same water properties measured by the Scanfish. Additional parameters including nutrient and particle concentrations were derived from bottle samples obtained during the CTD surveys. Vertical sections of bottle casts along the Plumes and Blooms trasect were also measured to assess the magnitudes of phytoplankton primary production. Various additional instruments were occasionally deployed to measure optical properties for characterizing the particle fields and dissolved components of the water column. Spatial variation in currents was measured continuously during the cruises with a ship-board Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). The data from these cruises is also being used to provide a valuable measure of the &quot;background state&quot; of the Channel with respect to seawater temperature, salinity, nutrient concentration, phytoplankton biomass, and primary productivity. Other on-going studies are examining links between circulation dynamics and patterns of primary productivity and phytoplankton.     An array of high frequency (HF) radars is currently operated along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel, northward along the central California coast, and on two of the Northern Channel Islands. The radar array currently consists of ten operational sites whose coverage includes the Santa Barbara Channel and extends from Pt. Mugu to Point Sal, and are part of a state-wide array operated by the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System and the Central and Northern California Coastal Ocean Observing System. These systems transmit radio waves over the sea surface and then receive signals which are scattered back toward the radars from ocean surface waves. Surface currents are determined by analyzing these back-scattered signals. The resulting data allow us to to map and monitor surface currents and regional ocean circulation in real-time. They provide an important link between regional circulation patterns in the channel and sub-surface property fields observed by moored instruments and other platforms. We use data from the HF radar array to examine the influence of larger scale circulation patterns in the Channel on the inner shelf and reef ecosystems and to increase understanding of a number of important dynamical processes in the Santa Barbara Channel.     Remote sensing data from various ocean color and the thermal imagery satellite missions are routinely collected and analyzed as part of the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER in collaboration with joint funding from NASA. This imagery provides 1-km scale regional views of ocean chlorophyll concentrations and sea surface temperature (SST) that are used to assess the occurrence, extent and duration of phytoplankton blooms and surface sediment plumes from discharged stormwater in the Santa Barbara Channel. Co-registered five-day composite fields for SST and chlorophyll concentration are created on a routine basis for the Santa Barbara Channel. Recent images can be viewed on the web at UCSB's Earth Research Institute (http://eri.ucsb.edu). Our focus on assessing the space/time characteristics of the chlorophyll imagery from SeaWiFS and the processes that control phytoplankton blooms has been productive with good relationships in the Channel between upwelling indices (wind and SST), and chlorophyll distribution and strong east to west gradients in chlorophyll found in our datasets. Ocean color imagery is also used to assess the dispersion of sediment plumes within the Santa Barbara Channel, providing a unique large-scale view of surface sediment distributions following runoff and storm events.     SBC LTER also collects times series data on ocean temperature, salinity and currents from moored sensors at four of our reef sites (Carpinteria, Naples, Arroyo Quemado, and Alegria). These sensors enable us to sample ocean conditions at a higher frequency and from a wider range of weather and storm conditions than can be achieved using research vessels. The SBC LTER recently acquired an ocean glider which will autonomously collect sections of these water properties in the near future. The SBC LTER is also beginning a program to measure changes in ocean acidification in the region.     We are using data analysis procedures to visualize and quantify sub-surface property distributions obtained from data from the extensive suite of shipboard, moored, and land-based instrumentation. Particular attention is being given to processing towed vehicle and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data, which are critical for understanding the role of ocean currents in structuring density, nutrient, and phytoplankton distributions offshore of the kelp forests. Characterizing the seasonal patterns in these properties, as well as changes at shorter time scales will help us to assess the role of &quot;open channel&quot; nutrient delivery to kelp forest reefs, and allow comparisons with nutrient subsidies from terrestrial and nearshore sources.

4	Overview	abstract	Understanding influences of terrestrial runoff on kelp forest ecosystems and near shore waters is a principal goal of our watershed research. Fluvial transport and processing of nutrients, organic matter and sediment are primary ways in which landscapes are linked to coastal ecosystems. The volume, transport, processing and chemical properties of runoff are controlled by the amount and pattern of rainfall, watershed area, topography, vegetation, soils, geology, land use and perturbations, such as fire. The numerous watersheds of the SBC region differ considerably in these characteristics, which allow for spatial comparisons of terrestrial inputs to coastal waters. The episodic nature and seasonal and interannual variations in stream flows characteristic of the region facilitate investigations of the consequences of temporal variation in terrestrial runoff.     As part of out long-term research we measure rainfall, stream discharge, and concentrations of dissolved and particulate constituents in a diverse array of watersheds that drain into the Santa Barbara Channel. Stream gauging stations located throughout the study region measure stream stage and water temperature year-round. Ratings curves derived from channel cross sections and roughness are used to convert these stream stages to discharge. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients (nitrate, phosphate, and ammonium), dissolved organic nitrogen, and particulate nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon, and total suspended solids are sampled during baseflow and intensively during stormflow and are combined with discharge data to determine fluxes.     Data on rainfall and runoff collected from a subset of the watersheds that vary in size and land use, are used to calibrate and validate a hydrologic model that we have developed. This model aids in evaluating how climate and land-use influence runoff into the coastal zone. Analyses of concentration versus runoff relationships reveal how land use and watershed hydrology influence solute concentrations in streams.  In our watersheds consistent nitrate-runoff patterns occur with dilution in agricultural watersheds, invariance in urban watersheds, and enrichment in an undeveloped watershed, as runoff increases.  Following fires a large pulse of ammonium export occurs and subsides after the first few storms, while nitrate and sediments yields remain high. On-going research will integrate hydrological models with water quality modules to simulate the discharge of water, associated solutes, and sediments from the land to the ocean.	1	2011-10-24 16:45:49.735967

10	Overview	abstract	One of the main strengths of the long term ecological research program is that it allows us to evaluate changes in the ecological community against the background of natural long-term variability. This long-term context is particularly important when we seek to distinguish between changes caused by natural processes and those caused by human activities. The Santa Barbara coastal LTER project is working to assemble the datasets necessary for such research in two ways:     First, the LTER has undertaken long-term monitoring, measuring the abundance of over 150 species of reef algae, invertebrates and fish along permanent transects at nine nearshore reef sites on the mainland coast and at 2 reef sites on Santa Cruz Island. This represents one of the core LTER activities and provides a comprehensive description of community structure on nearshore rocky reefs within our study site.     Second, the LTER has sought out other monitoring datasets from the Southern California region and is working to synthesize those datasets so that they are compatible with the SBC LTER monitoring data. These complementary monitoring projects include data collected at Santa Cruz Island by researchers at UCSB, data collected from San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz Anacapa, and Santa Barbara Islands by the National Park Service, and data collected at San Nicolas Island by the United States Geological Survey. They thus represent a substantial broadening of the spatial scale over which analyses can be performed. Additionally, because each of these modeling projects was initiated in the early 1980s, while the SBC LTER began collecting data in 2000, the addition of these data sets greatly increases our ability to characterize the long-term ecological dynamics of our region. Although each of these individual datasets have been analyze separately, they have never been combined, so our synthesized dataset provides a rich opportunity to track long-term changes in reef communities in the context of large scale physical and biotic processes in the Southern California Bight.     We are using this data set to ask several questions. First, how do short and long-term climate oscillations influence the species composition and trophic structure of kelp forest communities? A number of studies have shown that climate fluctuations such as El Nino and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation can affect kelp forest and fish communities. These data will allow us to look for similar patterns in whole reef community structure over a broad spatial area. Second, we will ask to what extent rocky reef community dynamics are best described as switches between distinct alternative community states. There are number of well-known examples of abrupt state changes on rocky reefs such as switches between kelp dominated and urchin dominated communities and switches between algal dominated or filter feeder dominated reefs; but the degree to which community dynamics as a whole in this region can be described by switches between states has not been explored. Finally, we will examine the effects of a number of recent changes in the region such as the establishment of marine protected areas and the return of sea otters. Only by understanding the expected variability in the system can we interpret the effects of these novel conditions.\r	1	2011-10-25 12:38:25.142376

14	Overview	abstract	The recognition that many species live in highly fragmented landscapes led to the development of metapopulation theory, which in its simplest form represents the idea that habitat patches suitable for local populations are either occupied or not and that connectivity among patches acts to &quot;rescue&quot; extinct local populations.  A central tenet of this theory is that the dynamics of local patches are at least partly asynchronous across the metapopulation.  Our research shows that a metapopulation framework is ideal for studying the regional dynamics of the giant kelp, <emphasis>Macrocystis pyrifera</emphasis> throughout the Southern California Bight.  Discrete patches of giant kelp vary asynchronously and undergo local extinctions and re-colonizations every couple of years due to physical and biological forcing that occurs across a wide range of spatial scales.  Most discrete patches of kelp occur within a couple of kilometers of other discrete patches, and we have shown using empirical measurements and theoretical estimates from physical transport models and population genetics models that kilometer-scale dispersal by giant kelp occurs routinely. We recently developed highly polymorphic microsatellite markers for giant kelp to characterize its population genetics.  We also developed a high resolution Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) solution for the Southern California Bight, which we are using to calculate Lagrangian particle trajectories for the purpose of estimating regional patterns of kelp spore dispersal.  We are using the data derived from the application of these recently developed tools to assess genetic connectivity among local populations of giant kelp in the Southern California Bight.     The vast majority of studies on metapopulation dynamics have focused on external environmental drivers that influence rates of local extinction and re-colonization.  There is growing interest in how internal mechanisms such as inbreeding depression influence metapopulation dynamics, yet there are few empirical examples that demonstrate this. Giant kelp is an ideal system for examining this mechanism because it has a high probability of inbreeding when dispersal is short and we have shown experimentally that inbreeding has significant adverse effects on the survivorship and reproduction of giant kelp.  Studies are under way to examine the role of inbreeding depression in controlling the dynamics of the metapopulation of giant kelp in the Southern California Bight.	1	2011-10-25 17:01:04.899478

7	Overview	abstract	Phytoplankton biomass and productivity in the Santa Barbara Channel are among the highest in the Southern California Bight supporting rich coastal ecosystems along the mainland coast. Located at the northern extreme of the Bight, phytoplankton dynamics and species composition within the Channel are influenced by the interplay between seasonal freshwater runoff, local circulation and large scale advection. As a result, phytoplankton biomass shows a high degree of variability on fairly small spatial scales of a few kilometers or less.     Using satellite ocean-color and sea-surface temperature (SST) imagery and associated environmental data to assess the occurrence, extent and duration of surface sediment plumes from discharged storm waters and phytoplankton blooms in the Channel, we have shown that coastal upwelling and terrestrial runoff are two major processes dominating variations in water turbidity and phytoplankton biomass. On seasonal timescales, the largest blooms are associated with cool upwelled waters in spring while elevated nearshore chlorophyll concentrations and values for an index for sediment-affected waters (LwN(555)) are related to sediment plumes from terrestrial runoff in late winter.  Interannual variations are consistent with remote forcing by El Nino cycles. During the 1997-1998 El Nino, chlorophyll concentrations were moderate, and El Nino-induced floodwater discharges result in high LwN(555) values throughout the Channel. However, a correspondence between the El Nino-La Nina state and chlorophyll concentration was not found for the Channel due to what appears to be the advection of nutrient-depleted waters from the east. Empirical plume and bloom indices show that plumes occur episodically in response to discharge events whereas blooms occur more regularly and can cover up to 95% of the Channel. SST and chlorophyll variations are driven by a coupling of advection and upwelling processes, and are not simply correlated to a single local forcing index.     Characterizing phytoplankton succession in the context of physical and chemical processes is important for understanding the mechanisms driving phytoplankton species composition and community dynamics. An understanding of these processes ultimately influences our ability to predict the contribution of phytoplankton to carbon cycling, the initiation and persistence of harmful algal blooms, and to use satellites for remote sensing of specific phytoplankton taxa important for biogeochemistry. An empirical orthogonal function analysis of 5 years (1998 - 2003) of phytoplankton pigment concentrations from a transect bisecting the Santa Barbara Channel revealed four dominant modes of variability that explained 80% of the variance in the pigment data set. The annual cycle is characterized by a switching from a mixed-phytoplankton assemblage mode to modes dominated by either diatoms, dinoflagellates, or a combination of nano- and pico-phytoplankton. The two dominant modes correspond to 1) a prebloom condition that precedes upwelling conditions, with all identified phytoplankton groups present in low abundance and 2) a diatom-dominated upwelling state that develops following spring upwelling.  Beginning in 2001, our analysis indicated a transition toward more intense diatom blooms in spring and summer and fewer, large dinoflagellate blooms, a trend that may be linked to an increase in local upwelling intensity between 2001 and 2003.  A number of spring diatom blooms occurring after 2001 have been harmful algal blooms, dominated by toxic <emphasis>Pseudo-nitzschia</emphasis> species which led to significant mortality in marine mammals and birds in the Santa Barbara Channel. To explore the possibility of predicting of toxigenic blooms of <emphasis>Pseudo-nitzschia</emphasis> in the Channel from environmental domoic acid concentrations, we created models incorporating satellite ocean color (MODIS-Aqua and SeaWiFS) and sea surface temperature (AVHRR) data to evaluate the probability that a remotely sensed phytoplankton bloom contains a significant population of toxic <emphasis>Pseudo-nitzschia</emphasis> spp.  Models correctly estimated 98% of toxic bloom situations, with a 7-29% rate of false positive identification.     Although the distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the Channel is complex, the long-term climatology of satellite ocean color reveals two distinctive features: 1) a maximum occurs north of Santa Rosa Island and over the Santa Barbara Basin; 2) another maximum extends along the mainland coast in the eastern Channel where the continental shelf widens. The relationship between spatial patterns in phytoplankton biomass and the underlying spatial and temporal patterns in phytoplankton primary productivity were examined using data from 16 cruises conducted three times each year from 2001 to 2006. Empirical orthogonal function analysis revealed three modes of variability that explained 89% of the variance in the productivity data set. The first mode, strongest during spring, describes seasonal productivity changes driven by coastal upwelling. The second mode, largest in spring and fall, describes productivity changes over the western Channel associated with cyclonic eddies. Eddy-enhanced productivity changes were superimposed on variable levels of channel-wide productivity caused by upwelling within the Channel. The cyclonic eddies influenced productivity through eddy-induced upwelling and through occasional entrainment of phytoplankton and nutrient from water upwelled north of Point Conception. The third EOF mode describes productivity gradients on the continental shelf along the mainland coast with enhanced productivity in the east during spring and fall.  Mode 3 accounted for a high fraction of the variance in productivity for stations located adjacent to the mouths of the two major rivers discharging into the Channel (The Ventura and Santa Clara rivers), but no direct relationship with runoff was apparent. Overall, our analysis shows that coastal upwelling combined with the effects of cyclonic circulation on particle retention and vertical nutrient supply combine to enhance phytoplankton biomass and productivity in the western Channel.     To address sources of phytoplankton to kelp forests a transect of five stations across the continental shelf from Mohawk kelp forest to 60 m water depth was established in 2008 and sampled for sixteen months for phytoplankton biomass, productivity and taxonomic composition across the shelf over the annual productivity cycle.  The continental shelf along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel is only a few kilometers wide increasing the likelihood of oceanic influences on the kelp forests on the inner shelf.  The influence of offshore waters was clear during spring upwelling when phytoplankton biomass, productivity and taxa were fairly uniformly distributed across the shelf.  Upon stratification of the water column all significant phytoplankton blooms were confined to the inner shelf. These results suggest that over the majority of the year the phytoplankton within kelp forests are derived from local production on the continental shelf with significant contributions from beyond the continental shelf being infrequent.\r	1	2011-10-29 11:15:11.326855

To understand this key ecosystem function in kelp forests, we are measuring net primary production (NPP) for the major types of primary producers in giant kelp forests: giant kelp, understory macroalgae, and phytoplankton.     Our ongoing research is investigating how the negative effects of giant kelp on understory algae and phytoplankton interact with wave disturbance and nitrogen loading to affect the magnitude and interannual variability of NPP by the kelp forest ecosystem as a whole.  Our long term kelp removal experiment is a focal point for ongoing studies of these questions.  This research is being facilitated by the use of a simple model of understory production which we developed that relates species-specific light use relationships measured in the laboratory to biomass and light levels measured in our long-term study plots. \n	1	2013-02-11 17:14:48.400596

43	Overview	abstract	We estimated connectivity and rates of fertilization in giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forests in southern California from a metapopulation perspective, based on our investigations of population dynamics. Those estimates, which took into account rates of colonization, extinction, and occupancy of discrete kelp patches, and the degree of connectivity (via spore dispersal) among them, as well as inbreeding depression, were based on empirical measurements from experimental populations and physical modeling.  Confirmation of our estimates of connectivity and inbreeding in Macrocystis can be most reliably obtained from genetic analyses. In collaboration with Drs. Filipe Alberto and Ester Serrao from the Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CMER) at the Universidade do Algarve, Portugal we are developing microsatellites that can be used to evaluate levels of connectivity and self-fertilization in giant kelp. We are also collaboratively developing a sampling protocol that will allow us to examine the genetic structure and dynamics of kelp populations in the Southern California Bight and elsewhere in the world.	1	2013-02-13 13:19:48.244326
44	Overview	abstract	Currents impinging on kelp forests deliver nutrients, plankton and organic carbon that can substantially subsidize the kelp forest community. The kelp forest in turn modifies the flow around and within its boundaries, and forest producers and consumers alter the flux of nutrients and particulates within the forest. With collaborative funding from the University of California’s Coastal Environmental Quality Initiative we are investigating linkages between hydrodynamics and kelp forest function. These studies specifically focus on determining: (1) the degree to which impinging flows enter the forest as opposed to being diverted around it, (2) rates of consumption and production of waterborne subsidies (i.e., nutrients, POM, DOM) by kelp forests, (3) the interaction of nutrients, light, and flow in determining kelp growth, and (4) the implications of forest-flow interactions for forest-dwelling suspension feeding invertebrates. Our extensive measurements of flow and kelp forest community structure, geochemical and biochemical analyses, and experimental manipulations exploit a breadth of expertise in hydrodynamics, marine ecology, biological oceanography, and algal physiology.	1	2013-02-13 13:21:31.632188
45	Overview	abstract	Marine systems provide a myriad of ecosystem services that drive human behavior and actions and are impacted by human-induced disturbances that vary in their form, frequency, and magnitude. In general, basic knowledge and the development of sustainable management of marine systems are limited by our understanding of human-environment interactions in these systems. The unique convergence of human and data resources across the social and natural sciences in the Santa Barbara Coastal and Moorea Coral Reef LTER programs is being used to pioneer a large-scale comparison of (1) human impacts on marine ecosystems, and (2) human adaptations to environmental change in these systems. These LTER programs offer an opportunity to examine how fishing, an economically and socially important form of disturbance, influences ecosystem services provided by marine biogenic habitat, specifically giant kelp forests and coral reefs. Our pilot project identifies the human activities at play in each system and examines changes in vital ecosystem services associated with kelp forests in the SBC LTER and coral reefs in the MCR LTER.  As an example, lobster fishermen have identified variability in giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) as a critical environmental factor influencing lobster populations in the Santa Barbara Channel. Data on commercial fishing effort and catch coupled with information obtained from interviewing fishermen will be used to investigate this and associated questions. Reef-specific catch and effort data will be integrated with SBC LTER kelp abundance data to explore relationships between commercial lobster fishing and giant kelp abundance. 	1	2013-02-13 13:22:37.134896

The SBCLTER is using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratio analysis of monthly water, kelp tissue and samples consumers of varying trophic status to evaluate the relative contribution of these sources to reef food webs. SBCLTER research has focused on beginning to characterize variability in the isotope values of potential food sources (phytoplankton, kelp, and terrestrial POM). To investigate sources of variability in values of marine POM, including contributions from phytoplankton, we are collecting monthly water samples and filtering them for POM from on and offshore of the reef, at locations less likely to be influenced by inputs from kelp or terrestrial runoff and more likely to reflect a primarily phytoplankton source at the three core SBCLTER research sites (Arroyo Quemado, Naples, Carpinteria). To identify the range of variability of isotopic ratio in kelp tissue, we concurrently collect kelp tissue samples from the three core research sites. To identify food sources used by reef consumers under different conditions of runoff, ocean climate and kelp production we have begun sampling a variety of reef consumers chosen to represent different trophic levels. Tissue samples were collected in April 2002 from the same species of consumers at four reef sites (Carpinteria, Naples, Mohawk, Arroyo Quemada), which vary in their proximity to sources of runoff and in their standing stock of giant kelp. We have also collected sediment samples at fixed distances from the source of runoff at four research sites (Naples, Goleta Bay, Mohawk, Carpinteria). This information will be used to evaluate whether these isotopic values differ enough from one another to permit the use of mixing models to estimate the contribution of each source to the reef food web.

This information will be used to evaluate whether these isotopic values differ enough from one another to permit the use of mixing models to estimate the contribution of each source to the reef food web.</para></abstract>

Data were collected within a mosaic of undeveloped, agricultural, and urban areas to examine relationships among land use, nutrients, algae, and dissolved oxygen (see paper, linked below). This dataset reports major dissolved nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, ammonium) and total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus, from May to September 2008, and percent cover of macroalgae (benthic and floating) at the same sites at the beginning and end of this period. Results from these data were reported in: Klose, K., Cooper, S. D., Leydecker, A. D. and Kreitler, J. 2012.

The presence of over 150 taxa of sessile invertebrates and macroalgae are recorded at 80 uniformly spaced points along permanent 40m x 2m transects. Multiple species can be recorded at any given point. Percent cover of a given species on a transect can be estimated from UPC observations as the fraction of total points at which that species was present x 100. The total percent cover of all species combined using this method can exceed 100%; however, the percent cover of any single species cannot exceed 100%. These data are part of SBC LTERs kelp forest monitoring program, which began in 2000 and was designed to track long-term patterns in species abundance and diversity of reef-associated organisms in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA, The sampling locations in this dataset include nine reef sites along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel and at two sites on the north side of Santa Cruz Island. These sites reflect several oceanographic regimes in the channel and vary in distance from sources of terrestrial runoff. Data collection began in 2000 and this dataset is updated annually.

The abundance and size of all taxa of resident kelp forest fish encountered along permanent transects are recorded at nine reef sites located along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel and at two sites on the north side of Santa Cruz Island. These sites reflect several oceanographic regimes in the channel and vary in distance from sources of terrestrial runoff. In these surveys, fish were counted in either a 40x2m benthic quadrat, or in the water parcel 0-2m off the bottom over the same area.

Percent cover is determined using a uniform point contact method that consists of noting the identity and relative vertical position of all organisms under 80 uniformly placed points located within a 1 m wide band centered on permanent 40 m transects in each sampling plot. Each species may only be recorded once per point. Using this method the percent cover of all species combined may exceed 100%, however, the maximum percent cover possible for any single species cannot exceed 100%. The kelp removal experiment was initiated in 2008 at selected reef sites along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. The following three giant kelp manipulations are maintained in sampling plots at each site: Control: Macrocystis pyrifera is left intact in a 2000 m2 plot.Annual removal: Macrocystis pyrifera is removed from an adjacent 2000 m2 plot once each winter and allowed to re-colonize over the course of the year.Continuous removal: Macrocystis pyrifera is removed from a 200 m2 area within the 2000 m2 plot on each sampling date.

The standing crop and loss rates of M. pyrifera are measured monthly in permanent plots at three sites in the Santa Barbara Channel, USA. Collection of these data began in May 2002 and is ongoing. Seasonal estimates of NPP and growth rate are made by combining the field data with a model of kelp dynamics. The dataset includes plant density in each plot and censuses of fronds on tagged plants at each site. NPP, mass specific growth rate and standing crop are presented in four metrics (wet mass, dry mass, carbon mass and nitrogen mass) to facilitate comparisons with previous studies of M. pyrifera and with NPP measured in other ecosystems.

NPP of understory taxa are calculated using field measurements of irradiance and biomass (derived from abundance) and laboratory estimates of taxon-specific photosynthetic parameters. NPP for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, is calculated using linear relationships between frond density in a given season and average NPP for that season. Importantly, estimates for understory species include production lost as dissolved exudates while estimates of NPP for giant kelp do not. The kelp removal experiment was initiated in 2008 at four reef sites along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. The following three giant kelp manipulations are maintained in sampling plots at each site: Control: Macrocystis pyrifera is left intact in a 2000 m2 plot.Annual removal: Macrocystis pyrifera is removed from an adjacent 2000 m2 plot once each winter and allowed to re-colonize over the course of the year.Continuous removal: Macrocystis pyrifera is removed from a 200 m2 area within the 2000 m2 plot on each sampling date.

NPP of understory taxa are calculated using field measurements of irradiance and biomass (derived from abundance) and laboratory estimates of taxon-specific photosynthetic parameters. NPP for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, is calculated using linear relationships between frond density in a given season and average NPP for that season. Importantly, estimates for understory species include production lost as dissolved exudates while estimates of NPP for giant kelp do not.</para><para>The kelp removal experiment was initiated in 2008 at four reef sites along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel.

54	54	SBC LTER: Giant kelp canopy biomass from LandSat 5, 1984 - 2011	kcavanaugh	st_study	f	2013-04-02 16:35:18.973686	These data are a time series of canopy biomass of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, derived from LANDSAT 5 TM satellite imagery. The kelp canopy is composed of potions of fronds floating on the surface of the water. Biomass data (wet weight) are given for individual 30 x 30 meter pixels in the coastal areas extending from Purisima Point, Santa Barbara County, to the US-Mexico border, including the Northern and Southern Channel Islands. The Landsat 5 program began in 1984. Observations are made on a 16 day reqeat cycle but the temporal coverage is irregular because of cloud cover and instrument failure. Estimates of kelp canopy biomass are derived from the relationship between satellite reflectance and empirical measurements of kelp canopy biomass in long-term SBC LTER study plots obtained using SCUBA. These data are presented in a published paper: Cavanaugh, K. C., D. A. Siegel, D. C. Reed and P. E. Dennison. 2011.
