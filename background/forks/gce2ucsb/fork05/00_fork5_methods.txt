Fork 5
Methods at the dataset and entity level.

backward compatible? yes 
essential? yes

Background:
SBC and MCR are pulling methods-xml from EML into Metabase. In phase I, this will be the entire contents of the methods node, as XML. In a later phase, we will parse features out of methods trees, and restructure as necessary (in consultation with Wade)

We pull it back out via mb2eml.

EML can accomidate methods at several levels, and SBC and MCR use at least 2 of these in phase I. 

Metabase has tables and columns for both these levels, in tables: 
DataSetMethods
DataSetENtityMethods 
Although our use does not follow Wade's patterns. 
GCE: Wade uses dataset-level methods for investigator-supplied text and entity-level methods only for processing steps generated by his matlab toolbox.
SBC/MCR: we put methods at the level that is most appropriate, eg, a CTD processing protocol is with the CTD dataTable (entity level), but the CTD sample collection protocol is at the dataset level because it applies to all data in the package, both electronic and water samples. 



Fork 5 Goals:
1. add an XML type to the cross-ref tables, for our Phase I.

TO DO:
get copyies of the alter table statements adding these columns.
