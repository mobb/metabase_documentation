Hi Margaret,

Sorry for the slow response, but I was on vacation when I received Gastil's email and I've been dealing with the usual post-return chaos ever since.

I think these proposed changes make sense, and would be easy to accommodate in our instance of the metabase as well. Separating project info from data set category info provides more flexibility moving forward, as does allowing data sets to span multiple projects. The multi-project concept would affect the way we deal with project tracking and reporting for GCE (and the way we generate project elements in EML), but that wouldn't be a big deal to change.

Even though the toolbox has gotten a lot of traction and dominated the work we've been doing with LNO-ARRA funds, we did propose to offer up a more generalized metabase model as part of that software ecosystem. I think including these changes (as well as rolling in the project and study tables from our ProjectDB content in a separate database) would be a good contribution to a more generalized metabase model with fewer legacy GCE features.

So I wouldn't consider this a fork - just you folks taking the lead on changing the model to accommodate broader use cases. Let us know how these changes work out and we'll roll them into the new "Metabase" (ne GCE_Metabase) GCE and CWT will be moving to over here later this spring/summer.

In short, GCE appears to consider datasets as belonging to only one project (and funding cycle), and for SBC and MCR, a dataset may span many funding cycles.

Now that you've started GCE-III, maybe you've already been thinking about a change like this.
