Fork 12
taxonomic coverage for datatsets.

backward compatible? yes 
essential? yes

Background:
A. Metabase does not include taxonomic tables. It has one cross-ref table called 
"DataSetSpecies", which probably could be used by external code to add taxonomic 
trees. GCE has a separate taxonomic database (see ERD in 
SBC's GCE_Metabase/datasets/Taxonomy directory.
 
B. MCR has taxonomic tables (in their production database on RDB1). Gastil will want
to generate EML taxonomic nodes from this. SBC will most likely copy that model.

C. Both sbc_metabase and mcr_metabase have a schema called "taxonomy" with one table 
containing some sample taxonomic xml. These will be removed, or (in SBC's case) 
replaced with tables copied from the MCR production database.


PHASE 1:
SBC and MCR will storing taxonomicCoverage nodes as XML in Metabase, and retrieve via mb2eml.

EML can accomodate temporal cov at several levels, and SBC and MCR use at least 2 (?? and maybe references via ids)


Fork 12 Goals:
1. handle taxonomicCoverage elements at 2 EML levels (dataset and entity, and with references if needed



General Approach:
There are no parent tables to populate.

A. these 2 x-ref tables were added (new) to the metabase2 schema.
DataSetTaxon
DataSetEntityTaxon
(DataSetVariableTaxon, maybe) 

See create table statements:
create_table_DataSetEntityTaxon.sql
vim create_table_DataSetTaxon.sql









TO DO:
get an image of 'original'
get a screenshot after schema spy is rerun.(see whiteboard of xref-tables till then.)
