Directory will hold history of forks between versions

A fork is a copy of a project (e.g., git repository) which allows you to freely experiment without affecting the original project. Forks are used to 

- propose changes to someone else's project 
- use someone else's project as a starting point for your own 

The forks described (to metabase) are mainly of the second type: a starting point for a new project.

Keep in mind: if you fork a project, but do not suggest merges to the original (or your changes cannot be merged), then that new forked-project is yours to maintain. 
This is especially important iIf you put the forked-project into a production system, because you cannot expect the original project to take care of it.
