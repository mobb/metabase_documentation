Directory will hold history of forks between versions

Keep in mind:
A fork is a copy of a repository which allows you to freely experiment without affecting the original project. Forks are used to 

- propose changes to someone else's project 
- use someone else's project as a starting point for your own 

These forks (to metabase) are mainly of the second type: a starting point for a new project.

Keep in mind: if you fork a project but do not suggest merges to the original (or your changes cannot be merged), then that new project is yours to maintain.
